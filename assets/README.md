# Assets

This folder is a suggested place to store game and engine assets:

- `textures/` – images, sprites, atlases
- `models/` – 3D models and meshes
- `audio/` – sound effects and music
- `shaders/` – shader source or binaries
- `scenes/` – scene or level definitions

You can adjust this layout to match how you load and organize resources in the engine.
